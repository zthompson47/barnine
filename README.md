# Barnine

A swaybar implementation using swaybar-protocol. It was built and
tested on Linux, but it might run on other systems. Incompatible
widgets should fail gracefully with a log message. I've been using
this as a hobby project to learn Rust, but I'm willing to maintain
the repository if it gets more users.
